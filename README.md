# Overview

Â A community event planner similar to groupMe. People can sign on and create events by adding their locations, names, times, and the nature of the event. These events would all be displayed on a schedule, and the creator of the event could make changes to the event that other users would see. This would allow for data to be stored that could easily be accessed by multiple users with multiple different access 'reasons'. It would allow for different users to have different privelages to communicate with the servers for. Additionally, it's similar to many of the assignments done in class although it adds new content and combines some sections making for a new experience to build.

I think scheduling apps are quite common, and it's an effective way to learn how to communicate between the server and several different users. It would require me to allow the data to be written to and accessed by user potentially at the same time without error. This would be another new experience, as previously we've only had to focus on one user reading/writing to the files. Additonally, it could be fun to implement some cool location. One could include weather, an RSVP system, and other cool features that would add to the depth and mechanical complexity.

Overall, I think it will be a simple project, yet one that allows for enough complexity to teach me some new skills and put all of the ones I've learned to good use. On top of that, I plan on using API's to save to files and running the pages on a hosted PAAS page for extra points. These are both new to me, but draw on our learned skills so they will allow for me to get familar with them without stepping wildly outside of what I know.

# Plan

### April 06:
  - Create Repository
  - Create project skeleton & files
  - Create Basic Schedule-Data Cards (i.e, the container for events)
  - Create very basic display for page 7 cards.

### April 13:
  - ALlow the user to create events
  - Events are displayed on a schedule
  - Events have some optional features (such as RSVPs, & Guest Lists)

### April 20:
  - Scheduled events are saved and stored through the API
  - Users can see other user's scheduled events.
  - Users can create their own schedule plan.
  - User can filter mass schedule by tags/requirements
  - Page can be hosted through Azure

### April 26:
  - Project finished.
  - Page fully hosted through Azure.
  - Data can be saved and loaded by multiple users at once.
  - Users can create their own schedules and publish public/private events.
  - Events can be limited to certain users (i.e a guestlist)
  - Events can last over multiple days
